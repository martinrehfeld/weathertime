=head1 NAME

Weather::Com - Perl extension for getting weather information from weather.com

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Data::Dumper;
  use Weather::Com;
  
  # define parameters for weather search
  my %params = (
		'current'    => 1,
		'forecast'   => 3,
		'links'      => 1,
		'units'      => 's',
		'proxy'      => 'http://proxy.sonstwo.de',
		'timeout'    => 250,
		'debug'      => 1,
		'partner_id' => 'somepartnerid',
		'license'    => '12345678',
  );
  
  # instantiate a new weather.com object
  my $weather_com = Weather::Com->new(%params);
  
  # search for locations called 'Heidelberg'
  my $locations = $weather_com->search('Heidelberg')
  	or die "No location found!\n";
  
  # and then get the weather for each location found
  foreach (keys %{$locations}) {
	my $weather = $weather_com->get_weather($_);
	print Dumper($weather);
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<Weather::Com> is a Perl module that provides low level OO interface
to gather all weather information that is provided by I<weather.com>. 

This module should not be used directly because of the business rules
applying if one want's to use the I<weather.com>'s I<xoap> interface.
These business rules enforce one to implement several caching rules.

Therefore, if you want to use a low level interface, please use
I<Weather::Cached> instead. It has the same interface as this module
but it implements all caching rules on it.

For a more high level interface please have a look at I<Weather::Simple>
that uses I<Weather::Cached> to get information and than provides the same
simple API than I<Weather::Underground> does.

As you'll see further below in this documentation, you'll need
to register at I<weather.com> to  to get a free partner id
and a license key to be used within all applications that you want to
write against I<weather.com>'s I<xoap> interface. 

L<http://www.weather.com/services/xmloap.html>

=head2 EXPORT

None by default. But there are a few static methods for conversion
purposes you may wanna use:

=over 4

=item * celsius2fahrenheit(celsius)

Takes the temperature in celsius and returns the temperature in fahrenheit
(as an integer value).

=item * fahrenheit2celsius(fahrenheit)

Takes the temperature in fahrenheit  and returns the temperature in celius
(as an integer value).

=item * convert_winddirection(direction)

Takes a wind mnemonic ("N", "WNW", etc.) or a long name of a wind direction
("North Northeast") and returns the other format.

The long names are only understood if used as follows:

				"North"
				"North Northwest"
				"Northwest"
				"West Northwest"
				"West"
				"West Southwest"
				"Southwest"
				"South Southwest"
				"South"
				"South Southeast"
				"Southeast"
				"East Southeast"
				"East"
				"East Northeast"
				"Northeast"
				"North Northeast"
				"Variable"

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new(hash or hashref)

The constructor takes a hash or a hashref containing a bunch of parameters
used to configure your weather search. None of these paramters is mandatory.
As there are reasonable defaults for any of them, you need only to provide
those parameters where you whish to go with non-default values.

The parameters in detail:

=over 4

=item current =>  0 | 1 

This parameter defines whether to fetch the current conditions of a location
or not.

Defaults to 0 (false).

=item forecast => 0 | 1 .. 10

This parameter defines whether to fetch a weather forecast or not. 

If set to 0 (false) no forecast is read, if set to a value 
between 1 and 10 a forecast for the number of days is requested. If
set to any other value, this is interpreted as 0!

Defaults to 0 (false).

=item links => 0 | 1

This parameter specifies whether to load some http links from I<weather.com>
also or not.

=item units => s | m

This parameter defines whether to fetch information in metric (m) or 
US (s) format. 

Defaults to 'm'.

=item proxy => 'none' | 'http://some.proxy.de'

Usually no proxy is used by the I<LWP::UserAgent> module used to communicate
with I<weather.com>. If you want to use an HTTP proxy you can specify one here.

=item timeout => some integer (in seconds)

The timeout for I<LWP::UserAgent> to get an HTTP request done usually is set to
180s. If you need a longer timeout or for some reasons a shorter one you can
set this here.

Defaults to 180 seconds.

=item debug => 0 | 1

Set debugging on/off.

Defaults to 0 (off).

=item partner_id => 'somepartnerid'

To be allowed to fetch weather information from I<weather.com> you need to
register (free of charge) to get a so called I<Partner Id> and a 
I<License Key>. 

=item license => 'somelicensekey'

See I<partner_id>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=head2 search(place to search)

Searches for all known location matching the provided parameter.

At I<weather.com> you have to request weather data for a specific location.
Therefor you first have to find the location id for the location you are
looking for. I<weather.com> provides two possibilities to search:

=over 4

=item 1. by name

You may search for a location by name, e.g. "Heidelberg", "Heidelberg, Germany",
"New York, NY", etc.

=item 2. by postal code

You may search for a location by the postal code.

=back

If the search causes an error, this methods dies with a (hopefully) helpful
error message. 

If the search returns no matches, 0 is returned.

Else, the method returns a hashref containing all locations found.
The hashref looks as follows if you search for I<Heidelberg>:

  $HASHREF = {
  	'GMXX0053' => 'Heidelberg, Germany',
  	'USKY0990' => 'Heidelberg, KY',
  	'USMS0154' => 'Heidelberg, MS'
  };

The keys of the hash are the location ids as used within I<weather.com>. 
This keys have to be used for fetching the weather information of one
location.

=head2 get_weather(location id)

This method fetches all weather information as defined by the object
attributes you may have modified while instantiating the weather
object. 

If an error occurs while fetching weather information, this method
dies setting $@ to a meaningfull error message.

The following hashref shows the maximum of data that can be fetched from
I<weather.com>. The parts of the hashref are explained afterwards.

  $HASHREF = {
  	'head' => {
  		'ur'     => 'mm',
